# DeepLearningExtremeEvents

First, download all files in this folder. The code to run is in files `main_ff.m`, `main_lstm.m`, and `main_rc.m`. Follow the directions within these files to make predictions using our trained neural networks, or to train your own neural networks to make predictions on our data.

Each file loads data from either `rossler_data.mat`, `FHN_data.mat`, `KF_fourier_data.mat`, or `KF_vorticity_data.mat`, depending on which you specify.

(The file `main_rc.m` will direct you to `main_rc.ipynb` at some point if you want to train a new reservoir computing network, as we implemented these networks in Python.)
